            <p>This website, developed as part of my WS101 project, focuses on advertising the importance of web development. It provides a comprehensive overview of the field, covering the roles of front-end developers who design user interfaces, back-end developers who handle server-side operations, and full-stack developers who integrate both aspects. The site also explores why web development is crucial in todayâ€™s digital landscape, highlighting its significance in enhancing business communication, supporting e-commerce, and driving overall success in the online world. Through this project, I aim to emphasize the necessity of a strong web presence as a cornerstone of modern business strategy.</p>

        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a range of activities, from creating the visual layout and user interface to coding the underlying functionality that powers a website. Web development encompasses both <strong>Front-end Development</strong>, which deals with the design and user experience of a site, and <strong>Back-end Development</strong>, which focuses on server-side programming, databases, and server management. Together, these elements ensure that websites are not only visually appealing and user-friendly but also functional and efficient. As technology evolves, web development adapts to new standards and practices, making it a dynamic and essential field in the digital world.</p>

                <p>A front-end developer focuses on the visual aspects of a website or web application that users interact with directly. They use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create layouts, design user interfaces, and ensure responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes. Their goal is to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience, making sure that the website looks appealing and functions smoothly from the user's perspective.</p>
